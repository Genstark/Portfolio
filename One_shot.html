        <p>
            In One Shot Birds, the player is given a single stone to knock out a group of birds positioned in various patterns. 
            The game presents a challenging scenario where the stone must be precisely aimed to hit as many birds as possible in one shot. 
            The birds are scattered across the screen, and the player needs to consider the distance, angle, and trajectory of the stone to 
            maximize the impact.

            The core challenge of the game lies in the limited number of shots â€” the player has only one stone. 
            There's no room for error, and missing a bird means failing the level. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases 
            with more complex bird arrangements and faster-moving targets. The player must strategize, analyze the situation, and make the 
            shot count. Only the most accurate and careful players can clear all the levels, as they need to eliminate all the birds with a 
            single, well-aimed shot.
